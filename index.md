## Welcome!

Thanks for dropping by. Allow us to introduce ourselves.

The GA4 Event Schema Org is an independent, community-driven initiative. Our goal is to create a set of universally- or at least broadly-adopted naming conventions for custom events and parameters in Google Analytics 4 (GA4 to its friends).

Google has already defined a number of "standard" events, however this list is by no means complete or exhaustive. We believe there are benefits to be gained from further standardisation and alignment across the industry.

### Who stands to gain from standards?

* Analytics consultancies, agencies and independent contractors
* In-house marketing and analytics teams
* Independent software developers building applications and tools to augment and integrate with GA4

A standard set of custom events and parameters will enable easier orientation, faster implementation, greater confidence in data and more innovation.

### Operating principles

We will operate following Open Source principles, set out in greater detail in the [Open Source Way](https://opensource.com/open-source-way).

To summarise:
* **Transparency.** Giving everyone access to all the information we have, publishing on this site and the Github repository that sits behind it.
* **Collaboration.** Working with anyone and everyone who wants to get involved in an open, positive way.
* **Release early and often.** An iterative approach will lead to better outcomes. We'll learn more from doing than talking.
* **Inclusive meritocracy.** Diverse perspectives are essential. Good ideas can come from anywhere and the best ideas should win. 
* **Community** Common goals supersede individual interests and agendas.

### The schema
[Version 0.1 of the schema exists here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ekAwEi_jgztQRYzkZ8y5mCPlt0e139fHvQxdpdQfSZU/edit#gid=0) as a view-only Google Sheet. You are welcome to download or make a copy. We plan to turn this into a table in a page on this site once we've reached "critical mass" in the sheet.

### How to get involved
Anyone is free to make suggestions for new custom events and parameters, using this Google Form. Make sure you leave your email so we can contact you 

If you'd like to get more involved in the conversation and debate, you can view the [Discussion in Github](https://github.com/Measurelab/GA4EventSchema/discussions). If you want to contribute, you'll need a Github account. [Create a free account here](https://github.com/join?source=comment-repo) if you don't already have one. No coding skills are necessary to join the discussion.
We are also considering creating a public channel on Measure Slack - once we have the bandwidth to monitor it and respond in a timely way!

If you'd like to be part of the panel that reviews and ratifies new suggestions, please email us  - Naturally, this requires a good level of understanding of GA4 custom events and parameters and a commitment to remaining actively involved.

Finally, anyone with the skills and inclination can propose changes to this site and the supporting wiki. You can peek under the hood in the [Github repository here](https://github.com/Measurelab/GA4EventSchema).

### Who exactly is the "we"?
The GA4 Event Schema Org was originally conceived by a bunch of people at the UK-based analytics consultancy, [Measurelab](https://www.measurelab.co.uk). Mark Rochefort, Julian Erbsloeh, Liam Grant, Daniel Perry-Reed, and Steven Elliott have contributed thus far. Join us!
