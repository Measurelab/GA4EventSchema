## Welcome

This is a message welcoming people to this project and perhaps providing a brief description of what this website is about. Enough for them to be able to judge whether to read on or run away.

[Link to the sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ekAwEi_jgztQRYzkZ8y5mCPlt0e139fHvQxdpdQfSZU/edit#gid=0) / or to a page with the sheet embedded.

### Mission statement
This is a more in-depth explanation of what we're trying to do here.

It should include:
- What the problem/challenge is that we're trying to solve
- Ambition - definition of success 
- Boundaries/limits of what we're taking on - what this is not supposed to be
- Operating principles we're going to try to adhere to

### How to get involved
Who this is open to (everyone).
What sort of help we need specifically - prompt people.
How you can sign up / get your name down.

### Latest updates 
A blog/change log of latest news and updates in reverse chronological order i.e. newest at the top. 
As soon as we have a few, we can move to a separate page.

### Contact 
Email address / dedicated slack channel on Measureslack?
Again - if there become a lot of ways to contact or we need more info here, we create a separate page.

### Contributors
Perhaps maintain a list of people who have signed up to the manifesto, agreed to be bound by operating principles, or just support the mission.
Do we actually want to set the bar higher for a contributor? Would these just be signatories?
